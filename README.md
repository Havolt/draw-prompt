# draw-prompt

draw-prompt is a site which will help people practice drawing. Users will be given a prompt and a timer for drawing the prompt. Once complete we will adjust the timer so they can attempt to draw it faster or more carefully.

We might be able to also pull in some reference images from a free stock image resource to help.
